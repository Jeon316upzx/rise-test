Hello 



This is my final solution for the rise technical test

To run this project locally:

i)clone 
ii) run npm install
ii) run npm test for the testcase



1) What is the best way to compute the planâ€™s performance for the year 2020?

Given the mixed nature of the goal plan, the plan's performance in terms of returns will be a summation of the fixed income(10% per annum) returns and the stock assets.


The Solutions I came up with especially when calculating the stock assets daily performance and grouping the stock data by date are in O(n2) cause of the loop in loop and 2(O)n respectively. 


Kindly toggle the protected variable in the protected middleware to be able to get the returns

Endpoints: 

Get plan

Get portfolio
http://localhost:3000/rise-test-api/v1/portfolio


get returns
http://localhost:3000/rise-test-api/v1/returns
